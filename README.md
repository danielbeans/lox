# The Lox Language
This project follows the guidance of the book [*Crafting Interpreters*](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. 

## The Goals of This Project
By reading this book, I intend to

- Implement interpreters using both Java and C
    - Provide features of a high level language like **dynamic typing** and **automatic memory management**
    - Translate Lox code into bytecode representation
- Explore the various ways source code is compiled/interpreted into machine code and their pros and cons
- Strengthen my skills in Data Structures such as **dynamic arrays**, **trees** and **hash tables**
- Improve on debugging and optimization, as well as learn benchmarking
- Get more comfortable with **Git**
